# Reservior Design optimization using NSGA-2
This repository contins the implementation of multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-2 in python. NSGA-II algorithm is used to optimize the design of a water tank as shwon below. The design requires that the area of the tank should be minimized and volume to be maximized. This was done as part of course Nature Inspired Computing at IIT-Gandhinagar.

The NSGA-II algorithm is implemented inside class NSGA2. The algorithm was run with 500 particles or individuals for 5 generations. To perform crossover, a blend crossover was used. Random mutation was performed on the offspring. The plot of pareto-front at generatio-2 is shown below. See the comple evolution of pareto front with generation here  <a href="https://youtu.be/Zg__5fNqXa8" target="_blank">Video</a>.
