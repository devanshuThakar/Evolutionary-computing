 ## PSO
 Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is used for finding an optimal path from a given network of cities. The problem statement is - given some cities and distances between every pair of cities. Depending on the Covid situation the cities are in different zones like red, yellow, green and white. An optimal path visiting each city with constraints based on color zone has to be found out. 
 This was done as the assignment for the course of Nature inspired computing at IIT-Gandhinagar.
 ### Visit each city only once 
 The evolution of cost function with iteration is shown. Also the evolution of the optimal path as algorithm progresses in iterations is shown.

 ### Cities can be visited more than once
