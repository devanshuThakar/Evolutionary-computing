# Evolutionary-computing
This repository contains the implementation of evolutionary computing algorithms of Differential Evolution(DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It also contains the implementaiton fo NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization problem. This was done as part of ES 615 : Nature Inspired Computng Course at IIT Gandhinagar 2021.
